            <h2>10. Subscription Tiers and Data Access</h2>

            <p>
                LeapNest offers three subscription tiers:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Free Tier: Limited to 2 properties (oldest active and oldest prospect property)</li>
                <li>Premium Tier: Up to 5 properties with workflow features (prospect → in-progress → active)</li>
                <li>Ultimate Tier: Unlimited properties with all premium features and priority support</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Your subscription tier determines which features and how many properties you can access. If your subscription expires or is cancelled, you will retain access to your data but may be limited to Free tier features. All your property data is preserved regardless of subscription status.
            </p>

            <h2>11. Data Retention</h2>

                We retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide
                services. Subscription and billing information may be retained for legal and accounting purposes even after account deletion. You can request deletion of your data at any time through the app settings.
            </p>
