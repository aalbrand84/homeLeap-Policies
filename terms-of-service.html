                By subscribing, you agree to:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Pay the full subscription fee at the time of purchase</li>
                <li>Payment processing through Apple In-App Purchase (iOS) or other platform payment providers</li>
                <li>Price changes will be communicated in advance and will not affect your current subscription period</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Auto-Renewal and Subscription Management</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>Automatic Renewal:</strong> Your subscription will automatically renew at the end of each subscription period (monthly or annual) unless you cancel it at least 24 hours before the end of the current period. You will be charged the full subscription price to your Apple ID account or other payment method on file.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>How to Manage Your Subscription (iOS):</strong> To cancel, manage, or change your subscription, you must do so through your Apple account settings. Please follow these steps:
            </p>
            <ol style="margin-left: 24px; margin-bottom: 16px;">
                <li>Open Settings on your iPhone or iPad</li>
                <li>Tap on your name (Apple ID) at the top</li>
                <li>Tap "Subscriptions"</li>
                <li>Find and select "LeapNest" from the list</li>
                <li>You can then cancel, change your plan, or view subscription details</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                <strong>Important:</strong> You can cancel your subscription at any time. If you cancel, you will continue to have access to Premium or Ultimate features until the end of your current paid subscription period. After the period ends, your subscription will not renew and you will lose access to Premium or Ultimate features, but you will retain access to all your data and Free tier features.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Subscription Period:</strong> Your subscription period begins immediately upon purchase and renews automatically at the end of each period unless cancelled. Monthly subscriptions renew every month. Annual subscriptions renew every 12 months.
            </p>

            <h3>Cancellation and Refunds</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>How to Cancel (iOS):</strong> For subscriptions purchased through the Apple App Store, you must cancel through your Apple account settings as described in the "Auto-Renewal and Subscription Management" section above. Cancellations cannot be processed through the LeapNest app settings for iOS subscriptions.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>When Cancellation Takes Effect:</strong> When you cancel your subscription, the cancellation will take effect at the end of your current subscription period. You will continue to have full access to all Premium or Ultimate features until the end of the paid period. Your subscription will not renew automatically after the current period ends.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>24-Hour Notice:</strong> To prevent automatic renewal for the next billing period, you must cancel your subscription at least 24 hours before the end of your current subscription period. If you cancel within 24 hours of the renewal date, you may still be charged for the next period, but your subscription will not renew after that period.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Refunds:</strong> Refunds for subscriptions are handled according to the policies of the platform through which you subscribed. For Apple App Store purchases, refunds are managed through Apple's refund policy and process. We do not provide direct refunds for subscriptions purchased through app stores. If you have questions about refunds, please contact Apple Support (for iOS subscriptions) or the appropriate platform support.
            </p>

            <h3>Subscription Changes</h3>
            <p>
                You may upgrade or downgrade your subscription at any time. Upgrades take effect immediately. Downgrades take effect at the end of your current billing period. If you downgrade from Premium or Ultimate to Free, you will retain access to all your data but may be limited to Free tier features (2 properties visible).
